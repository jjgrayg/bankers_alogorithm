# Bankers Algorithm

This is a class project to show understanding of the Banker's algorithm to find if a system is in a safe state, and what the safe sequence is

## How to Run
- Start by compiling the code using the command:
  - clang++ -Wall -std=c++20 bankers_algorithm.cpp -o bankers_algorithm
  
- Then the program can be run using the following command:
  - ./bankers_algorithm
  
## What it Does
The bankers_algorithm program utilizes the Banker's algorithm to determine if the following snapshot of the system is in a safe state and what the safe sequence is.
